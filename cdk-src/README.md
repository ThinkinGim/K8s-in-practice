# Kubernetes in production using CDK Python

This project will be crafted with a consideration for production-ready to make secure, reliable and efficient Kubernetes environment on AWS using EKS.

It is an implementation to make a manageable Kubernetes and associated resources as a code using CDK(https://aws.amazon.com/cdk). The reason why we decided write a code using cdk, there are some reasons:
- Programmable, it's able to write and manage familiar languages such as python, java and etc. It will have not just a benefit from grammartic things, but also it can be handling based on what you've experienced. You can make a concrete flow with conditional statement and loop, and besides you could still go toward with a methodology which is used in usual lise Test Driven Development.
